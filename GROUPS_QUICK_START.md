## ⚡ Quick Tips

### Tip 1: Use Descriptive Names
✅ "Boys 10-12 Swimming Group"  
❌ "Group 1"

### Tip 2: Preview Before Creating
The preview count shows how many campers match your filters. Use it to verify your criteria.

### Tip 3: Color Code Consistently
- Age groups → Shades of Blue/Green
- Gender groups → Pink/Blue
- Cabin groups → Orange/Yellow
- Special needs → Red

### Tip 4: Start Broad, Then Narrow
If unsure, start with just one filter (e.g., age range) and add more as needed.

### Tip 5: Check for Conflicts
When assigning groups to events, review the conflict report. It tells you:
- Who was successfully enrolled
- Who had conflicts (already enrolled, time conflicts, event full)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

**Q: My group shows 0 campers**  
A: Check your filter criteria - they might be too restrictive. Try removing filters one by one.

**Q: Can I manually add/remove specific campers from a group?**  
A: No, groups are dynamic based on filters. To include specific campers, adjust the filters or create a new group.

**Q: What happens if I delete a group?**  
A: Only the group definition is deleted. Campers are not affected. They remain in the system and in any events.

**Q: Can campers be in multiple groups?**  
A: Yes! A camper can match multiple group criteria and be included in multiple groups.

**Q: Do I need to update groups when I add new campers?**  
A: No! Groups are dynamic. New campers matching the criteria automatically appear in the group.

## 🎓 Pro Tips

### Use Groups for Recurring Activities
Create permanent groups for weekly recurring activities. Just assign them once per week.

### Combine with Sleeping Rooms
The "Quick Assign Sleeping Room" feature still works! Use groups for broad assignment, then fine-tune with individual sleeping rooms.

### Test with Small Groups First
When learning, create a small test group (e.g., ages 6-7) to see how it works before creating larger groups.

### Review Before Assigning
Click on a group to see exactly who's in it before assigning to an event.
