# Event Edit Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added the ability to edit events after creation through the Event Detail Modal, matching the functionality available in the Family Group Detail Modal.

## Changes Made

### 1. EventDetailModal Component (`src/components/modals/EventDetailModal.vue`)
- Added 'Edit' button to the modal footer (between Delete and Close buttons)
- Added 'edit' to the emits array to properly handle the edit event

### 2. EventFormModal Component (`src/components/modals/EventFormModal.vue`)
- Added `isEditing` prop (Boolean, default: false) to support both create and edit modes
- Updated modal title to show "Edit Event" when editing, "Create New Event" when creating
- Updated save button text to show "Save Changes" when editing, "Create Event" when creating

### 3. Calendar View (`src/views/Calendar.vue`)
- Added `editingEventId` data property to track which event is being edited
- Renamed `newEvent` to `eventFormData` for clarity (handles both create and edit)
- Added `editEvent()` method that:
  - Extracts event data from the selected event
  - Converts ISO timestamps to time strings (HH:MM format)
  - Populates the form with existing event data
  - Opens the modal in edit mode
- Added `closeEventModal()` method to reset the form and editing state
- Updated `createEvent()` to `saveEvent()` method that:
  - Handles both create and update operations
  - Preserves the event's original date when editing
  - Calls `store.updateEvent()` for existing events
  - Calls `store.addEvent()` for new events
  - Shows appropriate success messages
- Updated EventDetailModal binding to include `@edit="editEvent"`
- Updated EventFormModal bindings:
  - `:is-editing="!!editingEventId"`
  - `:form-data="eventFormData"`
  - `@close="closeEventModal"`
  - `@save="saveEvent"`

## User Experience
1. User views an event in the Calendar and clicks on it to open the Event Detail Modal
2. User clicks the "Edit" button
3. The detail modal closes and the Event Form Modal opens with pre-filled data
4. User makes changes and clicks "Save Changes"
5. The event is updated and a success message is shown
6. The modal closes and the calendar updates to reflect the changes

## Technical Notes
- The implementation follows the same pattern used in FamilyGroupDetailModal and FamilyGroups.vue for consistency
- The store already had an `updateEvent` method, so no store changes were needed
- Time conversion properly handles the ISO date format to HH:MM format for the form
- The original event date is preserved when editing (only time and other properties are updated)
- No linter or TypeScript errors were introduced
- All changes compile successfully

## Testing
- Build completed successfully with no errors
- TypeScript compilation passed
- No linter errors found
