# Gender-Based Cabin Assignment Feature

## Overview

Added gender field to children and implemented gender-based filtering for sleeping room (cabin) assignments to ensure appropriate cabin placement.

---

## 🎯 Feature Summary

Children now have a required `gender` field (`male` or `female`), and the system automatically filters available cabins based on gender compatibility when assigning sleeping rooms.

---

## 📋 Implementation Details

### 1. **Schema Updates**

#### OpenAPI Schema (`openapi.yaml`)
```yaml
Child:
  required:
    - gender  # Added to required fields
  properties:
    gender:
      type: string
      enum: [male, female]
```

#### TypeScript Types (`src/types/api.ts`)
```typescript
Child: {
  // ... other fields
  gender: "male" | "female";
}
```

---

### 2. **Data Updates**

#### Mock Data (`src/data/mockData.ts`)
All 8 mock children now have appropriate gender values:
- **Girls**: Emma, Olivia, Ava, Sophia
- **Boys**: Liam, Noah, Ethan, Mason

Each child is assigned to a gender-appropriate cabin:
- Girls → Girls cabins (Bluebird, Wildflower)
- Boys → Boys cabins (Eagle, Pinecone)

---

### 3. **UI Updates**

#### Campers View (`src/views/Campers.vue`)

**Display Changes**:
1. **Child Cards**: Gender badge displayed alongside age
2. **Detail Modal**: Gender shown with formatted label
3. **Form**: Gender selection dropdown added (Age/Gender row)

**Filtering Logic**:
```typescript
const getAvailableSleepingRooms = (childGender: 'male' | 'female') => {
  return store.sleepingRooms.filter(room => {
    // Mixed rooms accept all genders
    if (room.gender === 'mixed') return true;
    
    // Match room gender with child gender
    if (childGender === 'male' && room.gender === 'boys') return true;
    if (childGender === 'female' && room.gender === 'girls') return true;
    
    return false;
  });
};
```

**Form Updates**:
- Gender dropdown (Male/Female) added next to Age field
- Sleeping room dropdown dynamically filters based on selected gender
- Helper text shows when no cabins are available for selected gender

## 🔒 Business Rules

### Cabin Assignment Rules

| Child Gender | Can Assign To         |
|--------------|-----------------------|
| Male         | Boys cabins, Mixed cabins |

## 🎨 UI Components

### 1. **Child List Cards**

**Before**:
```
[Age 8] [2 Allergy(ies)]
```

**After**:
```
[Age 8] [Female] [2 Allergy(ies)]
```

### 2. **Add/Edit Child Form**

**Layout**:
```
First Name              Last Name
[___________]          [___________]

Age         Gender
[8]         [Female ▼]

Parent Contact
[parent@example.com]

Allergies
[Peanuts, Dairy]

Medical Notes
[Carries EpiPen]

Sleeping Room (Cabin)
[Select cabin ▼]
  - Bluebird Cabin (Girls)
  - Wildflower Cabin (Girls)
```

**Dynamic Filtering**:
- Selecting "Male" → Shows only Boys and Mixed cabins
- Selecting "Female" → Shows only Girls and Mixed cabins

### 3. **Child Detail Modal**

**Gender Section**:
```
Gender
[Female]  ← Badge with formatted label
```

## 📊 Data Flow

### Adding/Editing a Child

```mermaid
User selects gender (Male/Female)
    ↓
getAvailableSleepingRooms() filters cabins
    ↓
Dropdown shows only compatible cabins
    ↓
User selects cabin
    ↓
Child saved with gender + sleepingRoomId
```

### Validation Rules

1. ✅ Gender is **required** when adding/editing a child
2. ✅ Only compatible cabins appear in dropdown
3. ✅ If child has existing cabin assignment that doesn't match new gender, they can still save (manual override)
4. ✅ "Not assigned" option always available

---

## 🛡️ Safety & Compliance

### Why This Feature?

1. **Safety**: Ensures appropriate sleeping arrangements
2. **Compliance**: Meets camp regulations and parent expectations
3. **Organization**: Easier cabin management
4. **Conflict Prevention**: Reduces assignment errors

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] Validation: Prevent assigning male child to girls-only cabin (hard constraint)
- [ ] Warnings: Alert when child's gender doesn't match assigned cabin
- [ ] Bulk assignment: Auto-assign children to cabins by gender
- [ ] Cabin capacity: Show remaining spots by gender in mixed cabins
- [ ] Age groups: Combine age + gender filtering (e.g., "Girls 8-10")

## 🎯 Key Functions

### `formatGender(gender: string)`
Capitalizes gender for display:
- `"male"` → `"Male"`
- `"female"` → `"Female"`

### `formatRoomGender(gender: string)`
Formats cabin gender for display:
- `"boys"` → `"Boys"`
- `"girls"` → `"Girls"`
- `"mixed"` → `"Mixed"`

### `getAvailableSleepingRooms(childGender: 'male' | 'female')`
Filters cabins based on child's gender:
- Returns array of compatible cabins
- Always includes "mixed" cabins
- Matches gender-specific cabins

---

## 💡 Design Decisions

### Why Only Male/Female?

For initial implementation, kept it simple with binary gender options. This aligns with most overnight camp cabin structures which are traditionally gender-separated for safety and compliance.

**Considerations for Future**:
- Non-binary options could be added
- Mixed cabins provide flexibility
- Could add "Other" or "Prefer not to say" with special handling

### Why Filter Instead of Validate?

**Chosen Approach**: Filter dropdown to show only compatible options

**Alternative Considered**: Show all cabins but validate on save

**Reason**: 
- Better UX - prevents errors before they happen
- Clearer expectations - users see only valid choices
- Reduces cognitive load - no need to remember which cabins are compatible

### Why Allow "Not Assigned"?

Children might not have a cabin assignment yet (day-only camps, pending registration, etc.). The system allows flexibility while still enforcing gender rules when a cabin IS assigned.

---

## ✅ Validation Summary

### Required Fields (New)
- ✅ `gender` is now required when creating/editing children

### Dropdown Behavior
- ✅ Dynamically filters based on selected gender
- ✅ Shows helpful message when no cabins available
- ✅ Updates in real-time when gender changes

### Data Integrity
- ✅ All mock children have valid gender values
- ✅ All cabin assignments match child gender
- ✅ TypeScript enforces type safety
