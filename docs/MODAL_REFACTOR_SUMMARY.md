# Modal Refactoring Summary

## Goal
Refactor all form modals to be fully self-contained by moving slot content into the modal components themselves. Pass necessary data via props instead of using slots.

## Benefits
- ✅ **Simpler architecture** - No complex slot patterns to maintain
- ✅ **Easier to understand** - All form logic is in one place
- ✅ **Less error-prone** - No data binding issues between parent and child
- ✅ **More reusable** - Modals are truly standalone components
- ✅ **Better maintainability** - Changes to form fields only touch one file

## Progress Status

### ✅ All Completed (6/6)
1. **FamilyGroupFormModal** - Self-contained with campers, staff, rooms, and color picker
   - Props: `campers`, `staffMembers`, `sleepingRooms`
   - Parent view: `FamilyGroups.vue` - cleaned up
   
2. **RoomFormModal** - Self-contained with room type selector
   - Props: None needed (room types are static)
   - Parent view: `Rooms.vue` - cleaned up

3. **StaffMemberFormModal** - Self-contained with role and manager selectors  
   - Props: `staffMembers`, `currentMemberId`
   - Parent view: `StaffMembers.vue` - cleaned up

4. **CamperFormModal** - Self-contained with gender and family group selectors
   - Props: `familyGroups`
   - Parent view: `Campers.vue` - cleaned up
   
5. **GroupFormModal** - Self-contained with color picker, gender, allergies, and family group selectors
   - Props: `familyGroups`, `campers`
   - Parent view: `Groups.vue` - cleaned up
   
6. **EventFormModal** - Self-contained with room, type, color, and camper groups selectors
   - Props: `rooms`, `camperGroups`, `campers`
   - Parent view: `Calendar.vue` - cleaned up
   - ⚠️ **Bug Found & Fixed**: Save handler wasn't using emitted form data (see below)

## Refactoring Pattern

### Step 1: Update Modal Component
1. Import needed components (`Autocomplete`, `ColorPicker`, etc.)
2. Add props for data needed (arrays of options, etc.)
3. Remove `<slot>` tags and replace with actual form controls
4. Move any computed properties needed from parent to modal
5. Add component styles if needed

### Step 2: Update Parent View
1. Remove all `<template #slot-name>` content
2. Add props to modal component binding
3. Remove unused computed properties
4. Remove unused imports
5. Remove unused styles

### Step 3: Test
1. Check for linter errors
2. Run build
3. Test form in browser

## Example: Before & After

### Before (with slots)
```vue
<!-- Modal Component -->
<template>
  <div class="form-group">
    <label>Type</label>
    <slot name="type-select" :formData="localFormData"></slot>
  </div>
</template>

<!-- Parent View -->
<MyFormModal :form-data="data" @save="save">
  <template #type-select="{ formData: modalFormData }">
    <Autocomplete v-model="modalFormData.type" :options="options" />
  </template>
</MyFormModal>
```

### After (self-contained)
```vue
<!-- Modal Component -->
<template>
  <div class="form-group">
    <label>Type</label>
    <Autocomplete 
      v-model="localFormData.type" 
      :options="typeOptions" 
    />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  props: {
    // ... existing props
  },
  data() {
    return {
      typeOptions: [...] // or computed if dynamic
    }
  }
}
</script>

<!-- Parent View -->
<MyFormModal :form-data="data" @save="save" />
```

## Build Status
✅ All refactored modals compile successfully
✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ No linter errors

## Bug Found & Fixed: EventFormModal

### Issue
After refactoring, it was discovered that the `EventFormModal` was not saving data correctly:
- Title wasn't being saved
- Campers from assigned groups weren't being enrolled
- All other form fields were not being persisted

### Root Cause
The `createEvent` method in `Calendar.vue` was not using the emitted form data. It was reading from `this.newEvent` (local data) instead of the `formData` parameter emitted by the modal.

### Fix
Updated the `createEvent` method to:
1. Accept `formData` as a parameter: `async createEvent(formData: any)`
2. Use `formData.*` instead of `this.newEvent.*` throughout the method
3. Properly check for `formData.camperGroupIds` when enrolling campers

### Files Changed
- `src/views/Calendar.vue` - Fixed the `createEvent` method

### Verification
All other modal save handlers (`saveGroup`, `saveCamper`, `saveMember`, `saveRoom`) were checked and confirmed to be correctly receiving and using the emitted form data parameter. The bug was isolated to the EventFormModal.

See `EVENT_FORM_MODAL_BUG_FIX.md` for detailed documentation of this fix.

## Next Steps
✅ All modals refactored and working correctly
✅ Bug found and fixed
✅ Documentation updated
