# Camper Groups - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Implementation

The backoffice feature for managing virtual camper groups has been successfully implemented and integrated into your camp manager application.

## What Was Built

### 1. **Core Types & Data Models** (`src/types/api.ts`)
- `CamperGroupFilter` interface for defining group criteria
- `CamperGroup` interface for group data structure
- Support for filtering by age, gender, sleeping rooms, and allergies

### 2. **Storage Service** (`src/services/storage.ts`)
- `getCamperGroups()` - Retrieve all groups
- `getCamperGroup(id)` - Get specific group
- `saveCamperGroup(group)` - Create or update group
- `deleteCamperGroup(id)` - Remove group
- Integrated with localStorage persistence

### 3. **Store Management** (`src/stores/campStore.ts`)
- `camperGroups` state for storing groups
- `getCamperGroupById()` computed property
- `getCampersInGroup(groupId)` computed property - dynamically filters campers
- `filterCampersByGroup()` helper function for applying filters
- `addCamperGroup()`, `updateCamperGroup()`, `deleteCamperGroup()` actions
- `enrollCamperGroup(eventId, groupId)` - Bulk enroll campers from a group to an event

### 4. **Groups Management View** (`src/views/Groups.vue`)
A complete backoffice interface with:
- **Grid View**: Display all groups with color-coding and member counts
- **Create/Edit Modal**: 
  - Name, description, and color picker
  - Age range filters (min/max)
  - Gender filter
  - Multiple sleeping room selection
  - Allergies filter
  - Real-time preview of matching campers
- **Detail View**:
  - Shows all filter criteria
  - Lists all matching campers with details
  - Metadata (created/updated dates)
- **Delete Confirmation**: Safe deletion with confirmation modal
- **Empty State**: Helpful messaging when no groups exist

### 5. **Calendar Integration** (`src/views/Calendar.vue`)
Added to event detail modal:
- **"Quick Assign Camper Group"** section (highlighted with primary border)
- Dropdown to select from available groups
- Shows count of campers in each group
- Assigns entire group to event with one click
- Conflict detection and reporting
- Success/error messaging

### 6. **Navigation & Routing**
- Added "Groups" route (`src/router/index.ts`)
- Added "Groups" link in sidebar with folder icon (`src/components/Sidebar.vue`)
- Accessible at `/groups`

### 7. **Mock Data** (`src/data/mockData.ts`)
Created 5 example groups to demonstrate features:
1. **Junior Campers** (ages 6-9) - Green
2. **Senior Campers** (ages 13+) - Blue
3. **Eagles & Hawks** (Cabins 1-2) - Orange
4. **Girls Power** (Female campers) - Pink
5. **Allergy-Aware Group** (Campers with allergies) - Red

## Key Features

### ✨ Dynamic Membership
Groups automatically update when campers are added or modified. If a new camper matches a group's criteria, they're included automatically.

### ✨ Flexible Filtering
Combine multiple criteria:
- Age ranges (min and/or max)
- Gender (male, female, or any)
- Multiple sleeping rooms
- Allergy status

### ✨ Bulk Assignment
Assign entire groups to events in one click from the Calendar view, with automatic conflict detection.

### ✨ Visual Organization
- Color-coded groups for easy identification
- Member counts displayed everywhere
- Clear filter criteria display

## How to Use

1. **Navigate to Groups** (new sidebar link)
2. **Create a group** with your desired criteria
3. **Go to Calendar** and click on any event
4. **Select a group** from the "Quick Assign Camper Group" dropdown
5. **Click Assign** to enroll all matching campers
