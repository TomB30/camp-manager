# Staff Availability Check - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a staff availability checking system that prevents double-booking of staff members when assigning them to events. The system provides real-time visual feedback showing which staff members are already assigned to overlapping events.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Conflict Detection Service

**File:** `/src/services/conflicts.ts`

Added a new method `canAssignStaff()` that:
- Checks if a staff member is available for a specific time slot
- Compares the requested time against all existing event assignments
- Excludes the current event when editing (prevents self-conflict)
- Returns detailed conflict information including the conflicting event

```typescript
canAssignStaff(
  eventStartTime: string | Date, 
  eventEndTime: string | Date, 
  staffId: string, 
  allEvents: Event[],
  excludeEventId?: string
): { 
  canAssign: boolean; 
  reason?: string;
  conflictingEvent?: Event;
}
```

### 2. Updated Event Form Modal

**File:** `/src/components/modals/EventFormModal.vue`

**New Props:**
- `eventDate: Date` - The date of the event for creating full timestamps
- `editingEventId: String` - ID of the event being edited (for excluding from conflict checks)

**New Computed Properties:**
- `eventStartDateTime()` - Combines event date with start time for full timestamp
- `eventEndDateTime()` - Combines event date with end time for full timestamp

**New Methods:**
- `isStaffAvailable(staff)` - Checks staff availability using the conflict detector

**Enhanced Methods:**
- `getStaffLabel()` - Now shows availability warnings with conflict details
- `getStaffOption()` - Includes availability information in dropdown options

**Template Updates:**
- Added help text explaining the availability indicators (✓ and ⚠️)

### 3. Updated Calendar View

**File:** `/src/views/Calendar.vue`

**New Method:**
- `getEventFormDate()` - Returns the appropriate date for the event form:
  - Event's original date when editing
  - Currently selected date when creating new

**Template Updates:**
- EventFormModal now receives `eventDate` and `editingEventId` props

## How It Works

### Creating a New Event

1. User selects a date in the calendar
2. Opens the "New Event" form
3. Selects start and end times
4. When viewing the staff assignment section:
   - System calculates full timestamps (date + time)
   - Checks each staff member against all events
   - Shows ⚠️ icon with conflict details for unavailable staff

### Editing an Event

1. User clicks on an existing event
2. Opens the "Edit" form
3. If time is changed:
   - System recalculates availability
   - Excludes the current event from conflict check
   - Updates staff availability indicators in real-time

### Visual Feedback

Staff members are displayed with clear indicators:
- **✓ Name - Role** = Has required certifications
- **⚠️ Name - Role (Already assigned to "Event Title" at 2:00 PM)** = Time conflict

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Conflict
```
Event 1: "Swimming Lessons" - 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM - Assigned: Mike Johnson
Event 2: "Arts & Crafts" - 2:30 PM to 3:30 PM - Trying to assign: Mike Johnson

Result: ⚠️ Mike Johnson - Counselor (Already assigned to "Swimming Lessons" at 2:00 PM)
```

### Scenario 2: Editing Without Conflict
```
Editing: "Swimming Lessons" - Changing time from 2:00 PM to 2:15 PM
Current Staff: Mike Johnson

Result: Mike Johnson shows as available (current event excluded from conflict check)
```

### Scenario 3: No Conflict (Different Times)
```
Event 1: "Morning Activity" - 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM - Assigned: Sarah Jones
Event 2: "Lunch" - 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM - Trying to assign: Sarah Jones

Result: Sarah Jones - Assistant Director (No warning, available)
```

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Double-Booking:** Immediately identifies when staff are already assigned
2. **Real-time Feedback:** Updates automatically as times change
3. **User-Friendly:** Clear visual indicators with detailed explanations
4. **Smart Editing:** Doesn't flag the current event as conflicting with itself
5. **Consistent with Existing System:** Uses the same conflict detector as camper scheduling

## Technical Details

### Time Overlap Detection

Uses the standard overlap algorithm:
```typescript
start1 < end2 && start2 < end1
```

This correctly handles:
- Complete overlaps (event fully within another)
- Partial overlaps (events partially intersect)
- Adjacent events (touching boundaries, no overlap)

### Performance Considerations

- Conflict checks are performed on-demand as computed properties
- Only checks staff members being displayed
- Efficient O(n) scan through events for each staff member
- Results are cached by Vue's reactivity system

### Data Flow

```
Calendar.vue (selectedDate)
    ↓
EventFormModal (eventDate prop)
    ↓
eventStartDateTime / eventEndDateTime (computed)
    ↓
isStaffAvailable(staff) (computed)
    ↓
conflictDetector.canAssignStaff()
    ↓
Visual indicator in UI
```

## Testing Checklist

✅ Create event and assign available staff
✅ Create event and assign unavailable staff (shows warning)
✅ Edit event time and verify availability updates
✅ Edit event without changing time (no self-conflict)
✅ Multiple staff members with different availability
✅ Events on different days (no conflict)
✅ Back-to-back events (no overlap = no conflict)
✅ Overlapping events show correct conflict message
✅ Staff with and without certifications

## Code Quality

- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ Type-safe TypeScript implementation
- ✅ Follows existing code patterns
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Clear variable and method names
- ✅ Reuses existing conflict detection logic

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
1. Option to filter list to show only available staff
2. Sort staff by availability
3. Show count of current assignments per staff member
4. Block assignment to unavailable staff (currently just warns)
5. Batch conflict checking for multiple staff assignments
6. Export conflict reports for administrators

## Files Modified

1. `/src/services/conflicts.ts` - Added `canAssignStaff()` method
2. `/src/components/modals/EventFormModal.vue` - Added availability checking
3. `/src/views/Calendar.vue` - Pass date context to modal

## Documentation Added

1. `/docs/STAFF_AVAILABILITY_CHECK.md` - Complete feature documentation
2. `STAFF_AVAILABILITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This implementation summary

## Compatibility

- ✅ Works with existing event system
- ✅ Compatible with certification requirements
- ✅ Integrates with camper group assignments
- ✅ Works across all calendar views (daily, weekly, monthly)
- ✅ Backward compatible (existing events not affected)

## Deployment Notes

No special deployment steps required. Changes are purely frontend and use existing data structures. No database migrations or API changes needed.
