## Data Model

### Camper
- Basic info: Name, age, parent contact
- Medical: Allergies, medical notes
- Registration date
- **Family group assignment** (required)

### Family Group
- Name and description
- **Assigned sleeping room** (required)
- **Assigned staff members** (array)
- Color for visual identification
- List of campers in the group

### Staff Member
- Basic info: Name, role, contact
- Certifications
- Assigned events
- Associated family groups

### Activity Room
- Name, type, capacity
- Location, equipment
- Usage tracking

### Sleeping Room (Cabin)
- Name, number of beds
- Location (free text)
- Assigned family groups (permanent through family group relationships)

### Event
- Title, description, time range
- Room assignment
- Capacity limits
- Enrolled campers
- Assigned staff
- Required certifications
- Color coding for calendar

### Camper Group (Dynamic)
- Name and description
- Filters: age range, gender, allergies, medical notes
- Color for visual identification
- Automatically populated based on filters

## Conflict Detection

The system automatically detects and prevents:

1. **Room Overcapacity**: Multiple overlapping events exceeding room capacity
2. **Event Overcapacity**: More campers enrolled than event capacity allows
3. **Camper Double-booking**: Camper enrolled in overlapping events
4. **Staff Double-booking**: Staff assigned to overlapping events
5. **Missing Certifications**: Events requiring certifications not held by assigned staff

Conflicts are displayed on the dashboard and prevent invalid enrollments.

## Future Enhancements

### Backend Development
The current version uses local storage with async functions to simulate a backend. The next phase will include:

- **Node.js/TypeScript** or **Go** backend
- RESTful API following the OpenAPI specification
- Database integration (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)
- User authentication and authorization
- Real-time updates with WebSockets
- Report generation (PDF exports)
- Email notifications for parents and staff

### Additional Features
- Multi-week/multi-session support
- Attendance tracking
- Payment and billing management
- Parent portal
- Photo sharing
- Emergency contact management
- Activity planning templates
- Resource inventory management

## Development Notes

### Mock Data
The application comes pre-seeded with sample data including:
- 48 campers with various ages and allergies
- 8 staff members with different roles
- 10 activity rooms of various types
- 6 sleeping rooms (cabins)
- 4 family groups assigned to cabins
- Sample events for a full week schedule
- Dynamic camper groups with various filters

### Type Safety
All data types are defined in the OpenAPI schema and automatically converted to TypeScript types, ensuring consistency when the backend is implemented.

### Storage Service
The `storageService` uses async functions to match the future API structure, making the transition to a real backend seamless.

## Contributing

This is the initial frontend-only version. When contributing:
1. Maintain TypeScript type safety
2. Follow the existing component structure
3. Update the OpenAPI schema if adding new data fields
4. Test conflict detection logic thoroughly
5. Ensure responsive design principles
