## 🎨 Key Features in Detail

### 1. Drag & Drop Event Management
- **Enroll campers** by dragging from sidebar to events
- **Move campers** between events with conflict validation
- **Visual feedback** during drag operations
- **Automatic capacity checking**

### 2. Smart Conflict Detection
The system prevents:
- Room overcapacity (overlapping events)
- Event capacity violations
- Camper double-booking
- Staff scheduling conflicts
- Missing required certifications

### 3. Modern UI/UX
- Clean, professional design
- Color-coded events and roles
- Visual capacity indicators
- Responsive layout (desktop/tablet)
- Intuitive navigation
- Modal-based forms

### 4. Data Management
- **Async storage operations** (ready for API migration)
- **Automatic data seeding** on first load
- **Reactive updates** across all views
- **Conflict recalculation** after changes

## 📝 OpenAPI Schema

The project includes a complete OpenAPI 3.0 specification defining:

**Entities:**
- Camper (with medical info)
- TeamMember (with certifications)
- Room (with capacity)
- Event (with enrollments)
- Conflict (for validation)

**Endpoints:** (Ready for backend implementation)
- CRUD operations for all entities
- Enrollment/unenrollment
- Conflict checking
- Search and filtering

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Start development server
npm run dev

# 3. Open browser
# Visit: http://localhost:5173

# 4. Explore the app
# - Check dashboard
# - Create new events
# - Drag campers to events
# - Monitor conflicts
```

## 🎓 Sample Data

Pre-loaded with realistic data:
- **48 campers** (ages 6-15, various allergies)
- **8 team members** (different roles and certifications)
- **10 rooms** (various types and capacities)
- **Multiple events** (full week schedule)

All interconnected and demonstrating key features.
